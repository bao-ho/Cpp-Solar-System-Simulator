## Solar System Simulator

### Description
I made a 3D simulator of the Solar System. The highlight of the simulator is the real mode where you can create a realistic Solar System from file, with actual physical parameters from which different properties of the planets can be observed.

### Technologies
- C++
- Qt - an IDE for creating GUI applications using C++
- VTK - a library for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization.
